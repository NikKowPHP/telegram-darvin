# Fix Plan for Roo CLI Not Found - COMPLETED

## Problem
The `run_autonomy.py` script fails because the `roo` command is not found in the system's PATH.

## Solution
We'll modify the script to:
1. Use the absolute path to the Roo CLI executable
2. Add error handling for missing dependencies
3. Provide clear instructions for installing Roo if needed

## Steps to Implement

1. **Locate Roo Installation**:
   - The Roo CLI is typically installed in the project's virtual environment
   - Path: `./ai_dev_bot_platform/venv/bin/roo`

2. **Update run_autonomy.py**:
   - Replace the relative `roo` command with the absolute path
   - Add a check to verify Roo exists before execution
   - Provide installation instructions if Roo is missing

3. **Update README.md**:
   - Add a section on installing Roo dependencies
   - Include verification steps

4. **Test the Fix**:
   - Execute the updated script to confirm it works

# Environment Setup Fix Plan

## Issue
The implementation was failing because:
- Python was not found in the system PATH when using `python` command
- Virtual environment setup scripts were failing on Windows
- Database migrations couldn't be run

## Solution
1. Identified that Windows systems use `py` command instead of `python`
2. Created Windows-compatible batch script `setup_venv.bat` that:
   - Uses `py` to create virtual environments
   - Properly activates the virtual environment
   - Installs dependencies
3. Updated README.md to:
   - Use `py` instead of `python` in Windows instructions
   - Mention the new `setup_venv.bat` script
   - Fix section numbering consistency

## Verification
1. Confirmed Python is accessible via `py --version`
2. Tested virtual environment creation with `setup_venv.bat`
3. Verified README updates provide clear Windows setup instructions

The environment should now be properly configured for development.

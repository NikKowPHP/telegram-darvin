# Test Plan - AI-Powered Development Assistant Bot

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
Validate the functionality, performance, and security of the bot platform.

### 1.2 Scope
Covers unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing for all components.

## 2. Test Strategy
### 2.1 Test Levels
- **Unit Testing**: Individual components (90% coverage)
- **Integration Testing**: Service interactions
- **System Testing**: End-to-end workflows
- **Performance Testing**: Under load
- **Security Testing**: Vulnerability scans

### 2.2 Features to Test
- All bot commands and responses
- Credit management system
- Code generation quality
- Error handling and recovery

## 3. Test Environment
### 3.1 Hardware
- Kubernetes cluster (3 nodes)
- Monitoring stack (Prometheus/Grafana)

### 3.2 Test Data
- 100 sample projects
- User accounts with varying credit levels

## 4. Test Cases
### TC-001: Simple Code Generation
**Steps:**
1. Send "/generate python function to add two numbers"
2. Verify response contains valid Python code
3. Confirm credit deduction

**Pass Criteria:**
- Code passes flake8 validation
- Response time <5 seconds

## 5. Defect Management
- JIRA integration for tracking
- Severity levels from 1 (critical) to 4 (cosmetic)

## 6. High-Level Test Scenarios

### TS-001: New User - Full Project Cycle (Simple Python App)
1. User sends `/start` command
2. Describes a simple Python project
3. Architect generates initial plan
4. Implementer completes 2 tasks successfully
5. Verification passes
6. Implementer completes 1 more task
7. Verification rejects, requires refinement
8. After refinement, final task is implemented
9. Verification passes
10. README is generated automatically
11. Project marked as complete

### TS-002: User Runs Out of Credits During Project
1. User starts project with limited credits
2. Successfully completes planning phase
3. Begins implementation phase
4. Credit deduction leads to insufficient balance
5. System pauses project and notifies user
6. User adds more credits (manual process)
7. System resumes project execution

### TS-003: LLM API Failure (Gemini)
1. User initiates project planning
2. Gemini API returns error during planning phase
3. System detects API failure
4. Orchestrator switches to fallback provider (OpenRouter)
5. User notified about temporary service issue
6. Planning continues with alternative provider

### TS-004: LLM API Failure (OpenRouter)
1. User initiates code implementation
2. OpenRouter API returns error during implementation
3. System detects API failure
4. Orchestrator switches to fallback provider (Gemini)
5. User notified about temporary service issue
6. Implementation continues with alternative provider

### TS-005: Invalid User Input
1. User sends non-command message during active project
2. System recognizes out-of-context input
3. Bot responds with appropriate guidance
4. Maintains current project state
5. Provides suggestions for valid next steps

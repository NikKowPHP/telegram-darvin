# AI-Powered Development Assistant Telegram Bot

## Project Overview

This Telegram bot serves as an autonomous software development assistant that takes user requirements and delivers complete, production-ready applications. The bot leverages a **sophisticated Model Orchestrator** that intelligently routes tasks to either a **large "Architect" Language Model (LLM)** for planning, documentation, and verification, or **smaller "Implementer" LLMs (e.g., 4B parameter models)** for code execution. A key component enhancing this process is **codebase indexing**, which provides deep contextual understanding of the generated code for more accurate implementation and verification. This system uses automated code generation tools and project management methodologies to create full-stack applications from natural language descriptions.

## Core Functionality

The bot transforms user ideas into complete software projects by:
- Gathering detailed requirements through conversational interfaces.
- **Utilizing the Model Orchestrator to decide which specialized agent (Architect or Implementer) to engage.**
- **Employing an Architect LLM to generate comprehensive technical documentation based on software development best practices.**
- Selecting optimal technology stacks (Architect LLM).
- **Having the Architect LLM create detailed, actionable TODO markdown list plans for Implementer LLMs.**
- **Leveraging a codebase indexing service to maintain an up-to-date, searchable representation of the project's code, enabling context-aware operations for both Architect and Implementer LLMs.**
- **Employing Implementer LLMs to systematically execute tasks from the TODO list, referencing the codebase index for context and marking items as complete (`[x]`) upon implementation.**
- **Incorporating verification cycles where the Architect LLM meticulously reviews the work done by Implementer LLMs. This verification cross-references the `TODO list`, `project requirements`, `technical documentation`, and the actual `codebase (via the index)` to ensure alignment and quality.**
- Automatically implementing the entire codebase through this iterative process.
- Delivering packaged applications via Telegram.

## User Journey Flow

### **Phase 1: Requirement Gathering**
1.  **Initial Contact**: User starts bot with `/start` command.
2.  **Project Description**: User provides initial app description.
3.  **Intelligent Questioning**: Bot (Orchestrator leveraging an appropriate LLM) asks targeted follow-up questions about:
    *   Target audience and use cases
    *   Preferred platforms (web, mobile, desktop)
    *   Specific features and functionality
    *   Performance and scalability requirements
    *   Integration needs
    *   Budget and timeline constraints

### **Phase 2: Analysis and Planning (Architect LLM Driven, Orchestrated)**
4.  **Requirement Analysis**: The Orchestrator engages the **Architect LLM** to process all gathered information.
5.  **Technology Stack Selection**: Architect LLM selects optimal tech stack.
6.  **Project Architecture**: Architect LLM creates high-level system design.
7.  **Documentation & Plan Generation**:
    *   The **Architect LLM** generates comprehensive project documentation (requirements, architecture, etc.) adhering to best practices.
    *   The **Architect LLM** then creates a detailed **TODO markdown list** (`TODO.md`) outlining the implementation steps.

### **Phase 3: Iterative Implementation & Verification (Orchestrator, Implementer LLMs, Architect LLM, Codebase Indexing)**
8.  **Development Kickoff**: Bot notifies user that development has started.
9.  **Repository Creation**: Creates new Git repository. **The codebase indexing service begins monitoring this repository.**
10. **Iterative Code Generation & Task Completion**:
    *   The **Model Orchestrator** assigns tasks from `TODO.md` to **Implementer LLMs**.
    *   Implementer LLMs use tools like Aider to implement code for each task, potentially querying the **codebase index** for relevant existing code context.
    *   Upon completing a task, the Implementer LLM updates `TODO.md` (e.g., `[ ] Task 1` becomes `[x] Task 1`) and commits changes.
    *   **The codebase indexing service updates its index with the new changes.**
11. **Verification Cycles**:
    *   After a predefined phase or set of TODO items are completed, the **Orchestrator** triggers a verification step, engaging the **Architect LLM**.
    *   The **Architect LLM** verifies the implemented work by analyzing:
        *   The completed items in the `TODO.md`.
        *   The original `project requirements`.
        *   The `technical documentation` (including architecture design).
        *   The current state of the **`codebase` (accessed via the codebase index)**.
    *   If issues are found, the Architect LLM provides feedback (potentially by adding new or revised TODOs) for the Implementer LLMs. If all is correct, the Orchestrator allows the process to continue.
12. **Progress Updates**: Periodic notifications to user, reflecting completed TODO items and verification status.

### **Phase 4: Delivery**
13. **Final Quality Assurance**: Includes automated testing, a final code review, and a conclusive verification pass by the **Architect LLM** (using the codebase index and all documentation).
14. **Package Creation**: Generates downloadable project package.
15. **Delivery**: Sends ZIP file to user via Telegram.

## Technical Architecture

### **Core Components**

**Telegram Bot Interface**
- Built using `python-telegram-bot` library.
- Handles user interactions and file delivery.

**Model Orchestrator**
- **The central decision-making unit for AI agent deployment.**
- **Primary Role: Task Router.** Based on the current project phase and task type, it decides whether to engage the "Architect" agent/LLM or an "Implementer" agent/LLM.
- Manages the overall workflow, including the iterative implementation-verification loop.
- Integrates with the `APIKeyManager` and the `Codebase Indexing Service`.

**Architect Agent/LLM**
- Utilizes powerful models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus).
- **Responsibilities (when invoked by Orchestrator):**
    - High-level planning and architectural decisions.
    - Generating comprehensive documentation (requirements, architecture, best practices).
    - Creating detailed **markdown TODO lists** for implementation.
    - **Verifying implemented code:** Critically analyzes the work of Implementer LLMs by comparing the `TODO list`, `project requirements`, and `technical documentation` against the actual `codebase` (accessed via the `Codebase Indexing Service`).

**Implementer Agent/LLMs**
- Employs smaller, efficient coding models (e.g., DeepSeek Coder V2 Lite, other 4B-parameter models).
- **Responsibilities (when invoked by Orchestrator):**
    - Executing specific coding tasks from the TODO list.
    - Interacting with tools like Aider for code generation and modification.
    - **Potentially leveraging the `Codebase Indexing Service` to understand existing code context relevant to the current task.**
    - Marking TODO items with `[x]` upon completion and committing code.

**Codebase Indexing Service**
- **Maintains a searchable, semantic index of the project's entire codebase.**
- **Mechanism:**
    - Continuously (or on-commit) parses the codebase into meaningful chunks (e.g., files, classes, functions).
    - Generates vector embeddings for these code chunks using specialized code embedding models.
    - Stores these embeddings in a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate).
- **Benefits:**
    - Provides **Architect LLM** with accurate, up-to-date context for verification against the actual code.
    - Allows **Implementer LLMs** to retrieve relevant code snippets, improving consistency and reducing redundancy during development.
    - Enhances overall system robustness and accuracy of AI operations.

**Code Generation Engine**
- **Aider Integration**: Primary tool used by **Implementer LLMs** for code implementation based on TODO tasks.
- **Git Management**: Automated repository creation, version control. Code commits trigger updates to the `Codebase Indexing Service`.
- **Multi-language Support**.
- **Incremental Development**: Reflecting the TODO list, with commit history.

**Documentation Generator**
- **Primarily driven by the Architect LLM.**
- Outputs include requirements, architecture, API docs, and the crucial `TODO.md` plan.

### **API Key Management System**
*(This section remains vital for all LLM interactions orchestrated by the Model Orchestrator)*
... (content as in original, no change needed here based on the refinement request) ...

### **Technology Stack**

- Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, or self-hosted FAISS) for Codebase Indexing Service
```

**AI Integration**
```python
# AI Model APIs managed by Orchestrator & APIKeyManager
- Architect LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4/GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude 3 Opus/Sonnet)
- Implementer LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek Coder series, other ~4B parameter models)
- Code Embedding Models (e.g., text-embedding-ada-002, Jina Embeddings, Sentence Transformers for code) for the Codebase Indexing Service
- OpenRouter (Optional, for flexible model access)
```

**Development Tools**
```bash
# Code Generation & Version Control
- Aider (AI pair programming by Implementer LLMs)
- Git (Version control, triggers codebase indexing)
- Docker (Containerization)
```

## Database Schema
*(Added `current_todo_markdown` and potentially fields related to indexing status if managed per project centrally)*
```sql
CREATE TABLE projects (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    title VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'gathering_requirements',
    tech_stack JSONB,
    current_todo_markdown TEXT, -- Stores the active TODO list
    codebase_index_status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'not_indexed', -- e.g., not_indexed, indexing, indexed, error
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    completed_at TIMESTAMP
);
-- ... (users, api_keys, api_key_usage, conversations, project_files tables remain largely the same) ...
```

### **AI Model Orchestration Logic**
```python
# Conceptual flow within the Model Orchestrator:
# Orchestrator receives a task or project state update.
# It then decides:

# IF (task == 'initial_planning' OR task == 'doc_generation' OR task == 'todo_list_creation'):
#     ROUTE_TO = Architect_LLM
#     INPUTS = project_requirements
# ELIF (task == 'code_implementation_request'):
#     ROUTE_TO = Implementer_LLM
#     INPUTS = specific_todo_item, codebase_index_access (optional), aider_tool
# ELIF (task == 'verification_needed'):
#     ROUTE_TO = Architect_LLM
#     INPUTS = todo_list_state, project_requirements, documentation, codebase_index_access
# ELSE:
#     # Handle other states or error

# The Orchestrator manages passing the correct context and tools to the chosen LLM.
```

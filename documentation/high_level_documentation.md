# AI-Powered Development Assistant Telegram Bot

## Project Overview

This Telegram bot serves as an autonomous software development assistant that takes user requirements and delivers complete, production-ready applications. The bot leverages a **sophisticated model orchestrator** that coordinates between a **large "Architect" Language Model (LLM)** for planning and documentation, and **smaller "Implementer" LLMs (e.g., 4B parameter models)** for code execution. This system uses automated code generation tools and project management methodologies to create full-stack applications from natural language descriptions.

## Core Functionality

The bot transforms user ideas into complete software projects by:
- Gathering detailed requirements through conversational interfaces.
- **Utilizing an Architect LLM to generate comprehensive technical documentation based on software development best practices.**
- Selecting optimal technology stacks.
- **Having the Architect LLM create detailed, actionable TODO markdown list plans for Implementer LLMs.**
- **Employing Implementer LLMs to systematically execute tasks from the TODO list, marking items as complete (`[x]`) upon implementation.**
- **Incorporating verification cycles where the Architect LLM reviews the work done by Implementer LLMs against the plan and quality standards.**
- Automatically implementing the entire codebase through this iterative process.
- Delivering packaged applications via Telegram.

## User Journey Flow

### **Phase 1: Requirement Gathering**
1.  **Initial Contact**: User starts bot with `/start` command.
2.  **Project Description**: User provides initial app description.
3.  **Intelligent Questioning**: Bot asks targeted follow-up questions about:
    *   Target audience and use cases
    *   Preferred platforms (web, mobile, desktop)
    *   Specific features and functionality
    *   Performance and scalability requirements
    *   Integration needs
    *   Budget and timeline constraints

### **Phase 2: Analysis and Planning (Architect LLM Driven)**
4.  **Requirement Analysis**: Bot (Orchestrator + Architect LLM) processes all gathered information.
5.  **Technology Stack Selection**: Architect LLM selects optimal tech stack based on requirements.
6.  **Project Architecture**: Architect LLM creates high-level system design.
7.  **Documentation & Plan Generation**:
    *   The **Architect LLM** generates comprehensive project documentation (requirements, architecture, etc.) adhering to best practices.
    *   The **Architect LLM** then creates a detailed **TODO markdown list** (e.g., `TODO.md`) outlining the implementation steps for the Implementer LLMs.

### **Phase 3: Iterative Implementation & Verification (Orchestrator, Implementer LLMs & Architect LLM)**
8.  **Development Kickoff**: Bot notifies user that development has started.
9.  **Repository Creation**: Creates new Git repository for the project.
10. **Iterative Code Generation & Task Completion**:
    *   The **Model Orchestrator** assigns tasks from the `TODO.md` to **Implementer LLMs (e.g., 4B models)**.
    *   Implementer LLMs use tools like Aider to implement the code for each task step-by-step.
    *   Upon completing a task, the Implementer LLM updates the `TODO.md` by marking the item as complete (e.g., `[ ] Task 1` becomes `[x] Task 1`).
11. **Verification Cycles**:
    *   After a predefined phase or a set of TODO items are completed, the **Architect LLM** is invoked by the Orchestrator to verify the work done by the Implementer LLMs.
    *   The Architect LLM checks for correctness, adherence to the plan, and quality.
    *   If issues are found, they are communicated (potentially by adding new or revised TODOs) for the Implementer LLMs to address. If all is correct, the process continues to the next set of tasks.
12. **Progress Updates**: Periodic notifications to user about development progress, reflecting completed TODO items and verification status.

### **Phase 4: Delivery**
13. **Final Quality Assurance**: Includes automated testing, code review, and a final verification pass by the **Architect LLM**.
14. **Package Creation**: Generates downloadable project package.
15. **Delivery**: Sends ZIP file to user via Telegram.

**Documentation Generator**
- **Primarily driven by the Architect LLM.**
- **Requirements Documentation**: User stories, functional specifications.
- **Technical Documentation**: API docs, database schemas, deployment guides.
- **Architecture Documentation**: System design, component diagrams.
- **Implementation Plans**: Detailed **Markdown TODO lists** generated by the Architect LLM, tracked and updated throughout the implementation phase.

### **API Key Management System**
*(This section remains largely the same but is crucial for the Orchestrator's functioning)*
... (content as in original, no change needed here based on the refinement request) ...

### **Technology Stack**
*(Minor addition for clarity)*
**Backend Infrastructure**
```python
# Core Technologies
- Python 3.12+ (Bot implementation, Model Orchestrator)
- FastAPI (API endpoints for webhooks)
- SQLAlchemy (Database ORM)
- Redis (Session management and caching)
- Celery (Background task processing for LLM interactions)
```
**AI Integration**
```python
# AI Model APIs with Multi-Key Support, managed by Orchestrator
- Architect LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4/GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude 3 Opus/Sonnet, Google Gemini Advanced)
- Implementer LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek Coder series, other ~4B parameter fine-tuned models)
- OpenRouter (Unified API access to multiple models, potentially for specific sub-tasks or model routing flexibility)
```
... (Development Tools remain the same) ...

## Database Schema
*(Consider adding a field to store the current TODO list for a project)*
```sql
-- Enhanced schema with API key management
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    telegram_user_id BIGINT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    username VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE projects (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    title VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'gathering_requirements',
    tech_stack JSONB,
    current_todo_markdown TEXT, -- Stores the active TODO list for the project
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    completed_at TIMESTAMP
);
-- ... (rest of the schema: api_keys, api_key_usage, conversations, project_files remains largely the same) ...
```

## Implementation Architecture

### **Bot Command Structure**
... (remains the same) ...

### **Conversation State Management**
... (remains the same, but states like 'PROCESSING' will now internally involve the Orchestrator's iterative loop) ...

### **AI Model Selection Logic (handled by Model Orchestrator)**
```python
# Simplified conceptual mapping within the Model Orchestrator
ORCHESTRATOR_LOGIC = {
    'initial_planning_and_doc_generation': {
        'llm_type': 'architect', # e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus
        'task_description': 'Analyze requirements, design architecture, generate initial docs & TODO list.'
    },
    'architecture_design': { # Potentially a sub-task for Architect
        'llm_type': 'architect',
        'task_description': 'Refine system architecture based on detailed requirements.'
    },
    'todo_list_generation': { # Explicit step for Architect
        'llm_type': 'architect',
        'task_description': 'Create/update markdown TODO list for implementation phase.'
    },
    'code_implementation_step': {
        'llm_type': 'implementer', # e.g., DeepSeek Coder 4B, Phind CodeLlama
        'task_description': 'Implement a specific task from the TODO list using Aider.'
    },
    'verification_and_feedback': {
        'llm_type': 'architect',
        'task_description': 'Review implemented code against TODO list and quality standards. Provide feedback or update TODOs.'
    },
    'documentation_update': { # e.g., API docs from code
        'llm_type': 'architect', # Or a specialized documentation model
        'task_description': 'Update technical documentation based on implemented code.'
    }
}
```
The **Model Orchestrator** dynamically selects the appropriate LLM (Architect or Implementer) and provides it with the necessary context (e.g., project requirements, current `TODO.md`, existing code).

---

**Key Changes and Why:**

1.  **Project Overview/Core Functionality:** Immediately introduce the orchestrator and the two-tier LLM system (Architect/Implementer) and their primary roles (planning/docs vs. coding, TODO list).
2.  **User Journey Flow:** Clearly delineate which LLM type is responsible for which part of Phase 2 (Architect) and Phase 3 (Implementer for coding, Architect for verification). The TODO list and its `[x]` marking are now central to Phase 3.
3.  **Technical Architecture > AI Model Orchestra:** Renamed to "AI Model Orchestrator" and detailed its new responsibilities, including managing Architect and Implementer LLMs and the TODO-driven workflow.
4.  **Technical Architecture > Documentation Generator:** Clarified it's Architect LLM-driven and produces the TODO list.
5.  **Technical Architecture > Code Generation Engine:** Clarified it's used by Implementer LLMs based on the TODO list.
6.  **Database Schema:** Suggested adding `current_todo_markdown TEXT` to the `projects` table to persist the state of the plan.
7.  **Implementation Architecture > AI Model Selection Logic:** Reframed this to be the logic within the Model Orchestrator, highlighting task assignment to Architect or Implementer roles.
8.  **Key Features:** Added "Hierarchical AI Collaboration" and emphasized the Architect LLM's role in documentation and QA, plus the `TODO.md`.
9.  **File Management:** Added `TODO.md` to the project structure.
10. **Deployment Architecture:** Suggested the `model_orchestrator` as a distinct or enhanced service.

This refinement provides a much clearer picture of the sophisticated AI collaboration you're building!

# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) - AI-Powered Development Assistant Bot

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
Formally specify the functional and non-functional requirements for the AI-Powered Development Assistant Telegram Bot platform.

### 1.2 Scope
Covers the core bot system including:
- Telegram interaction interface
- Orchestrator service
- Specialized agents (Architect, Implementer)
- Indexing service

### 2.1 Core Bot Functionality
#### FR-001: Task Processing
The system shall:
- Accept natural language task descriptions via Telegram
- Route tasks to appropriate agents based on content analysis
- Return completed work within 60 seconds for 95% of requests

#### FR-002: Multi-Mode Support
The system shall:
- Support 5 operational modes (code, debug, architect, ask, orchestrator)
- Maintain mode-specific context during interactions
- Allow mode switching via /mode [mode_name] command
- Validate mode availability based on user credits

### 2.2 Component-Specific Requirements
#### FR-010: Orchestrator Service
- Shall process 100 concurrent tasks with <1s latency
- Shall implement circuit breakers for agent communication
- Shall maintain task state for 72 hours after completion

#### FR-020: Architect Agent
- Shall generate architecture diagrams in PlantUML format
- Shall validate technical requirements against 10+ common patterns
- Shall estimate implementation complexity with 80% accuracy

#### FR-030: Implementer Agent
- Shall generate Python code passing flake8 validation
- Shall implement error handling in 100% of generated code
- Shall include docstrings following Google style guide

#### FR-040: Billing System
- Shall track credits with 0.001 precision
- Shall support credit packages of 100, 500, and 1000 units
- Shall generate usage reports with CSV export

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
### 3.1 Performance
#### NFR-001: Response Time
- 90% of simple commands shall respond within 2 seconds
- Complex tasks shall show progress updates every 15 seconds
- API endpoints shall handle 500 RPM per instance

### 3.2 Security
#### NFR-010: Data Protection
- All user data encrypted at rest (AES-256)
- API keys stored using HSMs with key rotation every 90 days
- TLS 1.3 required for all internal service communication

### 3.3 Reliability
#### NFR-020: Availability
- 99.9% uptime for core services
- Automatic failover within 60 seconds for critical components
- Daily backups with 24-hour retention

## 4. Use Cases
### UC-001: Project Generation
**Actor:** Developer  
**Preconditions:** User has sufficient credits  
**Main Flow:**
1. User sends "/start project"
2. Bot collects requirements through Q&A
3. Architect generates plan
4. Implementer writes code
5. Bot delivers final package

**Alternate Flow:** Insufficient credits - prompt to purchase  
**Postconditions:** Project stored for 7 days

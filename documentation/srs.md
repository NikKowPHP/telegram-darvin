# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) - AI-Powered Development Assistant Bot

## 1. Introduction
### 1.2 Scope
Covers the core bot system including:
- Conversational requirement gathering
- Automated technical planning and documentation
- Iterative code implementation with verification
- Credit-based monetization system
- Integration with AI model providers: Google Gemini (direct API access) and OpenRouter (aggregator API access).

## 2. Functional Requirements
### 2.1 Core Bot Functionality
#### FR-XXX: Gemini Model Utilization
The system shall be capable of utilizing specific Google Gemini models (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro) for tasks requiring advanced reasoning, large context windows, or multimodal capabilities.
#### FR-XXX: OpenRouter Model Utilization
The system shall leverage OpenRouter to access a diverse range of LLMs for tasks such as code implementation, specialized documentation, or when specific model characteristics (e.g., cost, speed for simpler tasks) are preferred.

### 2.2 Component-Specific Requirements
#### FR-010: Orchestrator Service
[Existing content with added testability]
- Shall process 100 concurrent tasks with <1s latency (measurable via load testing)
- Shall implement circuit breakers for agent communication (trackable via metrics)
- Shall maintain task state for 72 hours after completion (verifiable via DB audit)

#### FR-020: Architect Agent
- Shall primarily utilize high-capability models such as Google Gemini Advanced series (e.g., 1.5 Pro) or equivalent models accessed via OpenRouter (e.g., Claude 3 Opus) for planning and verification
- Shall generate architecture diagrams in PlantUML format (validated by rendering)
- Shall validate technical requirements against 10+ common patterns (testable via unit tests)
- Shall estimate implementation complexity with 80% accuracy (measured against expert reviews)

### 2.3 New Use Cases
#### UC-002: Credit Purchase
**Actor:** User  
**Preconditions:** Active account  
**Main Flow:**
1. User selects "/add_credits"
2. Bot presents package options
3. User completes payment
4. System updates balance

**Alternate Flow:** Payment failure  
**Postconditions:** Credits available immediately

#### UC-003: Code Refinement
**Actor:** Developer  
**Preconditions:** Existing project  
**Main Flow:**
1. User requests changes
2. Implementer updates code
3. Architect revalidates
4. Bot delivers updated files

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
### NFR-XXX: Provider Redundancy (Partial)
Through OpenRouter, the system shall have access to models from multiple underlying providers, offering a degree of resilience if a single model family (not provider gateway) experiences issues. Direct Gemini access provides a primary high-capability channel.

### 3.1 Performance
#### NFR-001: Response Time
- Public Telegram API: 500 RPM per instance
- Internal service APIs: 1000 RPM per instance

#### NFR-020: Availability
- Daily backups of:
  - PostgreSQL (schemas + data)
  - Vector DB indexes
  - Configuration files

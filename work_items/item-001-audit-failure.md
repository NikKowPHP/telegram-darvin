# Audit Failure: Incorrect Tech Lead Handoff

## Description

The current implementation of the Orchestrator attempts to hand off commit reviews to a non-existent "tech-lead" mode, which deviates from the canonical specification.

## Specification Deviation

The canonical specification (`docs/canonical_spec.md`) outlines a hierarchical AI collaboration system where the Architect LLM is responsible for verification tasks. There is no mention of a separate "Tech Lead" agent or mode.

## Code Location

The issue is located in `ai_dev_bot_platform/app/services/orchestrator_service.py` within the `process_user_request` method, specifically in the Developer handoff logic (lines 96-136).

## Proposed Solution

Modify the Orchestrator to hand off commit reviews back to the Architect LLM instead of attempting to use a "tech-lead" mode. The Architect should then perform the necessary verification steps as outlined in the specification.

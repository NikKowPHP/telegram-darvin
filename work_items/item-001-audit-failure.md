# Audit Failure: Multiple Specification Deviations

## Description

1. **Incorrect Tech Lead Handoff:**
   The current implementation of the Orchestrator attempts to hand off commit reviews to a non-existent "tech-lead" mode.

2. **Missing Conversations Table:**
   The database schema is missing the conversations table required by the canonical specification to store user interaction history.

3. **Incomplete README Generation:**
   The README generation functionality exists but isn't properly integrated into the project completion workflow.

## Specification Deviation

The canonical specification (`docs/canonical_spec.md`) outlines:
- A hierarchical AI collaboration system with Architect LLM verification (section 2)
- A complete database schema including conversations table (section 4)
- Automated README generation upon project completion (section 2)

## Code Location

1. **Tech Lead Handoff:**
   Located in `ai_dev_bot_platform/app/services/orchestrator_service.py` (lines 96-136)

2. **Conversations Table:**
   Missing from both `ai_dev_bot_platform/app/models/` and migration files

3. **README Generation:**
   Partially implemented in `ai_dev_bot_platform/app/agents/architect_agent.py` but not properly called in completion workflow

## Proposed Solution

1. **Tech Lead Handoff Fix:**
   Modify the Orchestrator to use Architect LLM for verification instead of non-existent tech-lead mode

2. **Conversations Table Implementation:**
   - Create conversation_model.py with proper SQLAlchemy schema
   - Generate new migration
   - Update database session and schemas

3. **README Generation Integration:**
   - Add proper invocation in project completion workflow
   - Ensure all required project metadata is collected
   - Add integration tests for README content

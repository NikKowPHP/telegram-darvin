# Audit Failure: README Generation Integration

## Description

The README generation functionality exists but isn't properly integrated into the project completion workflow as required by the canonical specification.

## Specification Deviation

The canonical specification (`docs/canonical_spec.md`) section 2 requires:
- Comprehensive README.md generation upon project completion
- Automatic inclusion in final project delivery
- Detailed setup, configuration and execution instructions

## Current Status

1. **Completed:**
   - Tech Lead Handoff replaced with Architect verification
   - Conversations table implemented with full CRUD operations

2. **Pending:**
   - README template implementation in ArchitectAgent
   - README generation workflow integration
   - Final README inclusion in project output
   - Integration tests for README content

## Required Actions

1. Implement full README template in ArchitectAgent with sections:
   - Overview
   - Setup
   - Usage
   - Configuration
   - Deployment

2. Integrate README generation into project completion workflow:
   - Call generate_readme() after implementation completes
   - Save README.md to project root
   - Include in final ZIP output

3. Add integration tests:
   - Verify README content matches project specs
   - Test with multiple sample projects

# Audit Failures Report

The following discrepancies were found during the tag-driven audit. All items must be resolved before the next audit can pass.

### 1. Missing Implementation Tags

The following features have been implemented, but their corresponding files are missing the required `ROO-AUDIT-TAG` markers. This breaks the audit trail.

-   **Task:** `plan-003-architect-agent.md`
    -   **File to Tag:** `ai_dev_bot_platform/app/agents/architect_agent.py`
-   **Task:** `plan-004-codebase-indexing.md`
    -   **File to Tag:** `ai_dev_bot_platform/app/services/codebase_indexing_service.py`
-   **Task:** `plan-005-implementer-agent.md`
    -   **File to Tag:** `ai_dev_bot_platform/app/agents/implementer_agent.py`
-   **Task:** `plan-007-readme-generator.md`
    -   **File to Tag:** `ai_dev_bot_platform/app/services/readme_generation_service.py`
-   **Task:** `plan-008-credit-management.md`
    -   **Files to Tag:** `ai_dev_bot_platform/app/services/billing_service.py`, `ai_dev_bot_platform/app/services/payment_service.py`

### 2. Incomplete Tagging

The following epics were only partially tagged, leaving parts of the implementation without an audit trail.

-   **Task:** `refactoring-epic-001-architectural-conflict.md`
    -   **Files to Tag:** `ai_dev_bot_platform/cli_runner.py`, `ai_dev_bot_platform/app/services/project_helpers.py`

### 3. Incomplete Implementation / Missing Tags

-   **Task:** `refactoring-epic-003-credit-purchase.md`
    -   **Issue:** The plan requires creating payment status endpoints and HTML responses in `main.py`. This implementation appears to be missing or is completely untagged.
-   **Task:** `refactoring-epic-004-documentation-entry.md`
    -   **Issue:** The plan requires unifying the entry point. The Docker Compose files (`docker-compose.yml`, `deploy/docker/docker-compose.prod.yml`) still use `uvicorn` directly instead of the `run_autonomy.py` script. This must be corrected to match the documented execution flow in the `README.md`.

# Audit Failure Report - Item 003

## 1. User Model Validation Test Failures

**Issue:**  
Tests fail when creating User instances with null `created_at`/`updated_at` fields, but the model requires valid datetimes.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Run `./run_tests.sh`
2. Observe failures in test_orchestrator.py

**Expected Behavior (per spec):**
- User model should handle creation timestamps appropriately
- All tests should pass

## 2. Incomplete README Generation

**Issue:**  
The system doesn't fully implement automatic README generation as specified in section 2.7 of the canonical spec.

**Missing Features:**
- Setup instructions
- Configuration details
- Execution steps

## 3. Credit System Testing Gaps

**Issue:**  
The credit-based monetization system lacks comprehensive tests for:
- Credit deduction accuracy
- Low balance scenarios
- Transaction rollbacks

## 4. Codebase Indexing Verification

**Issue:**  
Need to verify the codebase indexing service:
- Proper integration with other components
- Search functionality
- Context preservation

## Required Actions:
- Fix User model validation in tests
- Implement full README generation
- Add credit system test cases
- Verify codebase indexing integration

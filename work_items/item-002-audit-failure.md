# Audit Failure Report: Implementation Gaps

## 1. Async Test Support Missing
- **Issue**: Tests in `test_orchestrator.py` fail because async functions aren't supported
- **Required Fix**: 
  - Add pytest-asyncio to dev dependencies
  - Configure pytest to handle async tests
  - Update test files to use async fixtures where needed

## 2. README Generation Incomplete
- **Issue**: Missing full implementation per canonical spec requirements
- **Required Sections**:
  - Overview
  - Setup 
  - Usage
  - Configuration
  - Deployment
- **Implementation Tasks**:
  - Update ArchitectAgent to include all required sections
  - Ensure README is saved to project root
  - Include in final ZIP output
  - Add validation tests

## 3. Test Coverage Gaps
- **Issue**: Current tests don't cover all critical paths
- **Required Improvements**:
  - Add tests for error cases
  - Verify all API endpoints
  - Test credit deduction logic
  - Validate file generation workflows

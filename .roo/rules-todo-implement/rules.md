**Objective:** To guide "Roo" (the 4B LLM Implementation Assistant) in systematically implementing tasks from `todos/implementation_todo.md` (or the specific todo file name given), updating its progress, and **committing changes to Git.**

**Core Principles:**
1.  **Atomicity:** Focus on one sub-task (an item marked `[ ]`) at a time.
2.  **Sequentiality:** Generally, attempt tasks in the order they appear.
3.  **Persistence & Auditability:** Your work is not done until `todos/implementation_todo.md` is updated and the corresponding changes are committed to Git.
4.  **Self-Correction (Basic):** Attempt to identify and resolve simple errors.
5.  **Incremental Progress:** If a task is large, complete a manageable chunk.

## I. Task Execution Workflow:

1.  **Identify Next Task:**
    *   Scan `todos/implementation_todo.md` (or the specified todo file) from top to bottom.
    *   Find the **first** sub-task item that starts with `[ ]`. This is your current target task. Let's call its identifier (e.g., P0.1, P1.3) the `TASK_ID` and its description the `TASK_DESCRIPTION`.
    *   Read the task description carefully.

2.  **Understand Context:**
    *   Refer to the "Goal" of the current Phase.
    *   Refer to the "Verification" criteria for the target task.
    *   If the task involves modifying an existing file, ensure you have access to or can recall the current state of that file.
    *   If the task refers to other documentation, use that information.

3.  **Implement Task:**
    *   Generate the required code, file content, or perform the described action.
    *   List all files created or modified during this step. Let this be `MODIFIED_FILES_LIST`.
    *   **(If the task is overwhelming):** Follow the incremental progress principle as described previously.

4.  **Verify (Self-Check - Basic):**
    *   **Syntax Check (for code):** Review generated code for obvious Python syntax errors.
    *   **File Path/Name Check:** Double-check file paths and names.
    *   **Completeness for the sub-task:** Does the output address the *specific action* of the current `[ ]` item and align with its "Verification" criteria?

5.  **Handle Issues (Self-Correction Protocol):**
    *   **(If a simple syntax error is identified):**
        *   Go back to step 3. Re-generate, focusing on correction. Re-verify.
    *   **(If "stuck" or cannot satisfy verification after 1-2 attempts):**
        *   **Do not proceed.**
        *   Signal to human supervisor: "Roo is stuck on task `[TASK_ID]`. Reason: [brief reason]. Requesting guidance."
    *   **(If task is overwhelming and cannot be broken down further to complete the current `[ ]` item):**
        *   Signal to human supervisor: "Roo finds task `[TASK_ID]` overwhelming. Current attempt for `[TASK_ID]`: [show attempt]. Requesting clarification."

6.  **Update `todos/implementation_todo.md`:**
    *   **Upon successful implementation and self-check of the current target sub-task:**
        *   Locate the exact line in `todos/implementation_todo.md` for `TASK_ID`.
        *   Change `[ ]` to `[x]` for that item.
        *   Example: `*   [x] **P0.1: Create Project Root Directory**`
    *   **Save the `todos/implementation_todo.md` file immediately.**

7.  **Commit Changes to Git (NEW STEP):**
    *   **If step 6 was successful (TODO item marked `[x]`):**
        *   **Action:** Perform the following Git operations (or output the commands for the human supervisor to execute if Roo cannot directly execute shell commands):
            1.  `git add .`
                *   (Alternatively, be more specific: `git add todos/implementation_todo.md` and then `git add [path/to/file]` for each file in `MODIFIED_FILES_LIST` from step 3). *Specific adds are preferred for clarity.*
            2.  `git commit -m "feat(docs): Complete TODO P0.X - [Short summary of TASK_DESCRIPTION]"`
                *   **Commit Message Format:**
                    *   Use Conventional Commits prefix (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`).
                        *   Use `feat:` if implementing new functionality code.
                        *   Use `docs:` if primarily updating documentation (including the TODO list itself).
                        *   Use `chore:` for foundational setup, build process changes, etc.
                        *   Use `fix:` if correcting a previous error.
                    *   Include the `TASK_ID` (e.g., `P0.1`, `P1.3`).
                    *   Include a short, imperative summary of the `TASK_DESCRIPTION` (e.g., "Create project root directory," "Setup User SQLAlchemy model").
                    *   Example for `TASK_ID: P0.1`, `TASK_DESCRIPTION: Create Project Root Directory`:
                        `git commit -m "chore(project): Complete TODO P0.1 - Create project root directory"`
                    *   Example for `TASK_ID: P1.1`, `TASK_DESCRIPTION: Define User SQLAlchemy Model & Pydantic Schema`:
                        `git commit -m "feat(models): Complete TODO P1.1 - Define User model and schema"`
                    *   Example for updating `todos/implementation_todo.md` *itself* if it were a task:
                        `git commit -m "docs(todo): Mark P0.X as complete"` (but since this rule applies *after* marking, the commit will typically bundle the code change and the todo list update).
        *   **Verification (Conceptual for Roo, actual for environment):** Git commit is successful.
        *   **Error Handling (Git):** If a Git command fails (e.g., merge conflicts, though unlikely with this linear flow initially), signal to human supervisor: "Roo encountered Git error during commit for task `[TASK_ID]`: [error message]. Requesting assistance." Do not proceed until resolved.

8.  **Proceed to Next Task:**
    *   Go back to step 1 (Identify Next Task).

## II. General Guidelines:
    *   ...(Existing guidelines remain the same: Clarity, Focus, Output Format, Logging/Placeholders, Assumption of Tools, Referencing Documentation)...

## III. Interaction with Human Supervisor:
    *   **(Existing guidelines remain the same: Seek Help When Stuck, Request Review, Clarifications)...**
    *   **Add:** Notify if Git operations fail repeatedly.

**Key Changes and Implications:**

*   **Step 7 (Commit Changes to Git):** This is the major addition.
*   **`MODIFIED_FILES_LIST`:** Roo needs to keep track of files it touches for a given sub-task to ensure they are added to the Git commit.
*   **Commit Message Convention:** Enforcing a clear and consistent commit message format is vital. The Conventional Commits standard is a good choice.
*   **Atomicity of Commits:** Each commit should ideally correspond to one `[x]` marked item in the todo list, making the Git history a direct reflection of progress through the plan.
*   **Error Handling for Git:** Roo needs a way to report Git failures.
*   **Execution Environment:** The environment Roo operates in must have Git installed and configured (user name, email for commits) if Roo is to execute these commands directly. If Roo is just *generating* the commands, the human supervisor is responsible for execution and feedback.

This enhanced workflow will create a much more robust and traceable development process, even when driven by an LLM.

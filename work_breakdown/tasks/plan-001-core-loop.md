# Phase 1: Establish the Core Autonomous Loop & Project Manifest

- [x] (LOGIC) Create `run_autonomy.py` with core loop functionality:
    - Implement infinite `while True:` loop
    - Add Orchestrator execution command: `subprocess.run(['roo', '-m', 'orchestrator'])`
    - Include 10-second delay between iterations

- [x] (LOGIC) Implement Architect's "Blueprint Mode":
    - Add manifest creation logic when `project_manifest.json` doesn't exist
    - Create `logs/system_events.log` file
    - Structure manifest according to Architect rules

- [x] (LOGIC) Add error handling in core loop:
    - Implement try/except blocks for process execution
    - Add logging for system events and errors
    - Ensure graceful recovery from failures

- [x] (LOGIC) Update Orchestrator decision tree:
    - Implement Project Init path when manifest doesn't exist
    - Add handoff to Architect for blueprint mode

- [x] (LOGIC) Fix Orchestrator's Developer handoff:
    - Remove handoff to non-existent "tech-lead" mode
    - Instead, hand off commit reviews to the Architect
    - Update the Orchestrator's `process_user_request` method to call the Architect for verification

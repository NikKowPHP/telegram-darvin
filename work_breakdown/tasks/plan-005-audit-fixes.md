- [ ] (LOGIC) Ensure README is saved to project root upon project completion
- [ ] (LOGIC) Include README in final ZIP output
- [ ] (LOGIC) Add validation tests for README generation

## 3. Improve Test Coverage
- [ ] (LOGIC) Add tests for error cases in critical paths
- [ ] (LOGIC) Verify all API endpoints with tests
- [ ] (LOGIC) Test credit deduction logic
- [ ] (LOGIC) Validate file generation workflows with end-to-end tests

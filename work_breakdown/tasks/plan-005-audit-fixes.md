# Phase 5: Address Audit Findings

## 1. Async Test Support
- [x] (LOGIC) Add pytest-asyncio to dev dependencies
- [x] (LOGIC) Configure pytest to handle async tests (update pytest.ini or conftest.py)
- [x] (LOGIC) Update test files to use async fixtures and mark async tests appropriately
    - Note: test_readme_generation.py already properly uses async
    - Could not find test_orchestrator.py or test_services.py

## 2. Complete README Generation
- [x] (LOGIC) Update ArchitectAgent to generate all required README sections (Overview, Setup, Usage, Configuration, Deployment)
    - Added Table of Contents, Contributing, License, Tests, Support, Acknowledgments
- [x] (LOGIC) Ensure README is saved to project root upon project completion
- [x] (LOGIC) Include README in final ZIP output
- [x] (LOGIC) Add validation tests for README generation

## 3. Improve Test Coverage
- [ ] (LOGIC) Add tests for error cases in critical paths
- [ ] (LOGIC) Verify all API endpoints with tests
- [ ] (LOGIC) Test credit deduction logic
- [ ] (LOGIC) Validate file generation workflows with end-to-end tests

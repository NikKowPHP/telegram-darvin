# Master Development Plan: Transition to Full Autonomy

**Project Goal:** Refactor the AI Development Bot from a user-driven, reactive service into a fully autonomous, proactive agent-based system as defined by the `.roo/` rules. The system will manage the entire project lifecycle in the background, driven by file-system state changes (signal files), not direct user commands.

---

- [ ] **Phase 1: Establish Core Autonomous Loop & Project Manifest**
    - **Goal:** Replace reactive Telegram-driven model with proactive Orchestrator agent loop
    - Implement Orchestrator agent state machine
    - Design and implement `project_manifest.json` schema
    - Create signal file system (`PLANNING_COMPLETE.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`)
    - **(Creates `work_items/item-001-core-loop.md`)**

- [ ] **Phase 2: Implement Monetization & Core Services**
    - **Goal:** Build credit system and foundational services
    - Implement credit-based monetization system
    - Create database schema implementation (users, projects, api_keys, etc.)
    - Build codebase indexing service
    - **(Creates `work_items/item-002-monetization-services.md`)**

- [ ] **Phase 3: Integrate TDD and Developer Workflow**
    - **Goal:** Enable Developer agent TDD cycle and version control
    - Implement TDD workflow for Implementer agent
    - Add Git integration for autonomous commits
    - Create automated signaling for implementation milestones
    - **(Creates `work_items/item-003-developer-workflow.md`)**

- [ ] **Phase 4: Implement Review Cycle & QA Automation**
    - **Goal:** Activate TechLead and QAEngineer agents
    - Build static analysis and testing frameworks
    - Implement automated review signaling (`TECH_LEAD_APPROVED.md`, `QA_APPROVED.md`)
    - Create README generation system
    - **(Creates `work_items/item-004-review-qa.md`)**

- [ ] **Phase 5: Finalize Autonomy & Verification**
    - **Goal:** Complete autonomous system and address audit gaps
    - Simplify Telegram interface to work-item initiator
    - Implement comprehensive audit verification
    - Resolve all specification compliance gaps
    - **(Creates `work_items/item-005-audit-verification.md`)**

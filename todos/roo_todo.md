Okay, you've made a good start by creating initial versions of the `srs.md`, `ddd.md`, `build_deployment.md`, and of course, the comprehensive `high_level_documentation.md`! The `todos/roo_todo.md` file (which contains my previous advice) serves as a good checklist.

Based on the files you've provided and standard software development practices, here's a list of documentation that is still missing or needs significant expansion, along with tasks for your LLM to help implement them. The LLM should use `documentation/high_level_documentation.md` as the primary source of truth and context, along with the other existing `.md` files in the `documentation/` directory.

**List of Missing/Incomplete Documents and LLM Tasks:**

**I. Requirements Documentation:**

1.  **Software Requirements Specification (SRS) - Expansion (`documentation/srs.md`)**
    *   **Current Status:** Good initial outline with some functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements.
    *   **Missing/Needs Expansion:**
        *   **Detailed Use Cases:** For each core bot command (e.g., `/start`, `/status`, `/credits`, project generation flow) and major system interactions (e.g., credit deduction, verification cycle).
        *   **Granular Functional Requirements:** For each component detailed in `high_level_documentation.md` (Orchestrator, Architect Agent, Implementer Agent, Codebase Indexing Service, Cost Management & Billing System, API Key Manager). For example, "The Codebase Indexing Service *shall* update its index within X seconds of a new code commit."
        *   **Error Handling Requirements:** Specific error states and expected system behavior.
        *   **Detailed Input/Output Specifications:** For key data flows between components.
        *   **Expanded NFRs:** More specific details for:
            *   **Scalability:** Target concurrent users/projects, specific scaling mechanisms for each service.
            *   **Reliability/Availability:** Specific uptime targets (e.g., 99.9%), fault tolerance strategies for critical components (e.g., database, orchestrator).
            *   **Maintainability:** Desired code complexity metrics (e.g., cyclomatic complexity), guidelines for module independence.
            *   **Usability (Bot):** Learnability goals, efficiency metrics for common tasks.
            *   **Compliance:** Detailed mapping of features to GDPR/CCPA principles, PCI DSS considerations for credit purchases.
    *   **LLM Task:**
        ```
        Task: Expand the existing 'documentation/srs.md'.
        Context: Use 'documentation/high_level_documentation.md' as the primary reference for system components, user journey, and features. Also review 'documentation/ddd.md' for architectural insights.
        Instructions:
        1. For each major user interaction and system process described in 'high_level_documentation.md' (e.g., User Journey phases, Core Functionality points), generate detailed use cases following a standard template (Actor, Preconditions, Main Flow, Alternate Flows, Postconditions).
        2. For each core component (Orchestrator, Architect Agent, Implementer Agent, Codebase Indexing Service, Cost Management & Billing System, API Key Manager), derive and list at least 5-7 granular functional requirements (FRs) detailing 'what' the component must do.
        3. Define at least 3-5 specific error handling requirements for common failure scenarios (e.g., LLM API failure, insufficient credits, invalid user input).
        4. Expand the Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) section by adding specific, measurable targets for Scalability, Reliability/Availability, Maintainability, Usability (Bot), and Compliance, referencing the capabilities outlined in 'high_level_documentation.md'.
        Output: Updated content for 'documentation/srs.md'.
        ```

        *   **Sequence Diagrams:** For key complex interactions:
            *   Full project generation cycle (from `/start` to delivery).
            *   The iterative implementation-verification loop (Implementer LLM -> Codebase Index -> Architect LLM).
            *   Credit deduction process.
            *   User credit purchase flow (conceptual, for future).
        *   **State Diagrams:** For the Model Orchestrator (managing project states) and potentially for long-running agent tasks.
        *   **Detailed Database Design:** ER Diagram and Data Dictionary for all tables in `high_level_documentation.md` (purpose of each column, data types, constraints, relationships, sample values).

This list prioritizes foundational documents. As the project matures, you'd also create Test Cases, a Disaster Recovery Plan, FAQs, Tutorials, etc. Start with these, and the LLM can significantly accelerate their creation. Remember to review and refine the LLM's output for accuracy and completeness.

Okay, here's a very simple  file designed to guide a small 4B model to address the critical issues identified in your verification summary.

This TODO list breaks tasks down into extremely small, explicit steps.

```markdown


**Overall Goal:** Resolve critical discrepancies identified in the codebase to ensure basic functionality and structural correctness.

**Instructions for Roo (the 4B LLM):**
1.  Implement one task (marked `[ ]`) at a time.
2.  After successfully implementing a task and verifying it, change `[ ]` to `[x]` for that task in *this* file (`fixit_todo.md`).
3.  Save this file.
4.  Only proceed to the next task.

## Phase 1: Create Missing Core Application Directories

**Goal:** Ensure all essential application directories from P0.3 are present.

*   `[x]` **FIX1.1: Create `app/api/` directory and `__init__.py`**
    *   Action:
        1.  Create the directory `ai_dev_bot_platform/app/api/`.
        2.  Create an empty file named `ai_dev_bot_platform/app/api/__init__.py`.
    *   Verification: The directory `ai_dev_bot_platform/app/api/` exists and contains an empty `__init__.py` file.

*   `[x]` **FIX1.2: Create `app/background_tasks/` directory and `__init__.py`**
    *   Action:
        1.  Create the directory `ai_dev_bot_platform/app/background_tasks/`.
        2.  Create an empty file named `ai_dev_bot_platform/app/background_tasks/__init__.py`.
    *   Verification: The directory `ai_dev_bot_platform/app/background_tasks/` exists and contains an empty `__init__.py` file. (This addresses part of RF2.1)

*   `[x]` **FIX1.3: Create `config/` directory (project root level for platform config)**
    *   Action: Create the directory `ai_dev_bot_platform/config/`.
    *   Verification: The directory `ai_dev_bot_platform/config/` exists.

---

## Phase 2: Create Missing Project-Level Directories

**Goal:** Ensure other essential project-level directories are present.

*   `[x]` **FIX2.1: Create `tests/` directory (project root level)**
    *   Action: Create the directory `ai_dev_bot_platform/tests/`.
    *   Verification: The directory `ai_dev_bot_platform/tests/` exists. (This addresses part of RF2.2)

*   `[x]` **FIX2.2: Create `scripts/` directory (project root level)**
    *   Action: Create the directory `ai_dev_bot_platform/scripts/`.
    *   Verification: The directory `ai_dev_bot_platform/scripts/` exists. (This addresses part of RF2.3)

*   `[x]` **FIX2.3: Create `deploy/kubernetes/` directory**
    *   Action: Create the directory `ai_dev_bot_platform/deploy/kubernetes/`.
    *   Verification: The directory `ai_dev_bot_platform/deploy/kubernetes/` exists.

## Phase 3: Resolve ImplementerAgent - Orchestrator Mismatch

**Goal:** Modify `ImplementerAgent` to provide output in the format expected by `ModelOrchestrator`.

*   `[x]` **FIX3.1: Modify `ImplementerAgent` Prompt for Single File Output**
    *   File: `ai_dev_bot_platform/app/agents/implementer_agent.py`
    *   Action: Change the `system_prompt` in the `implement_todo_item` method.
        *   **Current `system_prompt` might be (example):**
            ```python
            """You are an expert software developer. Implement the following task in the specified tech stack.
            Tech Stack: {tech_stack_str}
            Project Context:
            {project_context}

            Instructions:
            1. Generate only the code required for the task.
            2. Do not include any explanations, markdown, or extra text.
            3. If the task requires multiple files, generate them in the format:
               ```filename.ext
               // code
               ```
            4. If the task is unclear, make a best-effort implementation.
            5. Use the tech stack exactly as specified.
            """
            ```
        *   **New `system_prompt` should be:**
            ```python
            f"""You are an expert software developer. Implement the following task in the specified tech stack.
            Tech Stack: {tech_stack_str}
            Project Context:
            {project_context}

            Instructions:
            1. Generate ONLY the code for the task.
            2. The output should be for a SINGLE file.
            3. Start your response with the filename on the VERY FIRST line (e.g., `my_new_file.py`).
            4. On the NEXT line, begin the code content for that file.
            5. Do NOT include any other explanations, markdown, or extra text. Just the filename and then the code.
            Example:
            src/utils/helper.py
            def my_helper_function():
                pass
            """
            ```
    *   Verification: The `system_prompt` in `implement_todo_item` method within `ai_dev_bot_platform/app/agents/implementer_agent.py` is updated to the new version.

*   `[ ]` **FIX3.2: Modify `ImplementerAgent` to Parse Filename and Code**
    *   File: `ai_dev_bot_platform/app/agents/implementer_agent.py`
    *   Action: Change the `implement_todo_item` method to parse the `code_response` and return a dictionary with `filename` and `code` keys.
        *   **Current return part (example):**
            ```python
            # ...
            # code_response = await self.llm_client.call_openrouter(...)
            return {"raw_code_response": code_response}
            ```
        *   **New logic before return:**
            ```python
            # ...
            # code_response = await self.llm_client.call_openrouter(...)

            filename = None
            code_content = ""
            if code_response and "\n" in code_response:
                try:
                    lines = code_response.split("\n", 1)
                    filename = lines[0].strip()
                    if len(lines) > 1:
                        code_content = lines[1]
                    else: # Only filename was provided
                        code_content = "" 
                except Exception as e:
                    logger.error(f"ImplementerAgent: Error parsing filename and code: {e}")
                    # Fallback if parsing fails, or return an error structure
                    filename = "error_parsing_filename.txt" 
                    code_content = code_response # return raw response as code
            elif code_response: # No newline, assume it's all code or a filename only
                # This simple logic assumes if no newline, it might be a filename or just code.
                # For simplicity for 4B model, let's assume it's code without a clear filename.
                # A more robust solution would handle this better.
                filename = "unknown_file.txt" # Default filename if only one line.
                code_content = code_response
            
            return {"filename": filename, "code": code_content.strip()}
            ```
    *   Verification: The `implement_todo_item` method in `ai_dev_bot_platform/app/agents/implementer_agent.py` now includes parsing logic for `filename` and `code` from `code_response` and returns `{"filename": filename, "code": code_content.strip()}`.

## Phase 4: Update Main TODO List Status (`todos/implementation_todo.md`)

**Goal:** Correct the status of specific tasks in the main `implementation_todo.md` file based on the verification summary.

*   `[ ]` **FIX4.1: Mark P1.6 in `todos/implementation_todo.md` as Complete `[x]`**
    *   File: `todos/implementation_todo.md`
    *   Action: Locate the line for task `P1.6: API Key Manager - Basic Structure`. Change `[ ]` to `[x]`.
    *   Line should become: `*   [x]` **P1.6: API Key Manager - Basic Structure**
    *   Verification: The line for P1.6 in `todos/implementation_todo.md` is correctly marked `[x]`.

*   `[ ]` **FIX4.2: Mark RF2.1 in `todos/implementation_todo.md` as Incomplete `[ ]`**
    *   File: `todos/implementation_todo.md`
    *   Action: Locate the line for task `RF2.1: Create ai_dev_bot_platform/app/background_tasks/ Directory`. Change `[x]` to `[ ]` because FIX1.2 addresses this. (Actually, this task in `implementation_todo.md` *was* marked as `[x]` but the directory was missing. Now that FIX1.2 will create it, this task from the *old* todo can be considered fulfilled by proxy, or more accurately, FIX1.2 made RF2.1 truly complete. Let's align: if FIX1.2 is done, RF2.1 in the *old* `implementation_todo.md` should remain `[x]` or be confirmed as `[x]` if it wasn't).
    *   **Clarification for Roo:** If FIX1.2 was successfully completed, the goal of RF2.1 *is* now met. Ensure the line for RF2.1 in `todos/implementation_todo.md` is `[x]`.
    *   Line should be: `*   [x]` **RF2.1: Create `ai_dev_bot_platform/app/background_tasks/` Directory**
    *   Verification: The line for RF2.1 in `todos/implementation_todo.md` is marked `[x]`.

*   `[ ]` **FIX4.3: Mark RF2.2 in `todos/implementation_todo.md` as Incomplete `[ ]`**
    *   File: `todos/implementation_todo.md`
    *   Action: Locate the line for task `RF2.2: Create ai_dev_bot_platform/tests/ Directory`. Change `[x]` to `[ ]` because FIX2.1 addresses this.
    *   **Clarification for Roo:** If FIX2.1 was successfully completed, the goal of RF2.2 *is* now met. Ensure the line for RF2.2 in `todos/implementation_todo.md` is `[x]`.
    *   Line should be: `*   [x]` **RF2.2: Create `ai_dev_bot_platform/tests/` Directory**
    *   Verification: The line for RF2.2 in `todos/implementation_todo.md` is marked `[x]`.

*   `[ ]` **FIX4.4: Mark RF2.3 in `todos/implementation_todo.md` as Incomplete `[ ]`**
    *   File: `todos/implementation_todo.md`
    *   Action: Locate the line for task `RF2.3: Create ai_dev_bot_platform/scripts/ Directory`. Change `[x]` to `[ ]` because FIX2.2 addresses this.
    *   **Clarification for Roo:** If FIX2.2 was successfully completed, the goal of RF2.3 *is* now met. Ensure the line for RF2.3 in `todos/implementation_todo.md` is `[x]`.
    *   Line should be: `*   [x]` **RF2.3: Create `ai_dev_bot_platform/scripts/` Directory**
    *   Verification: The line for RF2.3 in `todos/implementation_todo.md` is marked `[x]`.

*   `[ ]` **FIX4.5: Mark RF4.1 in `todos/implementation_todo.md` as Complete `[x]`**
    *   File: `todos/implementation_todo.md`
    *   Action: Locate the line for task `RF4.1: Mark P1.6 in todos/implementation_todo.md as Complete`. Change `[ ]` to `[x]`.
    *   Line should become: `*   [x]` **RF4.1: Mark P1.6 in `todos/implementation_todo.md` as Complete**
    *   Verification: The line for RF4.1 in `todos/implementation_todo.md` is correctly marked `[x]`.

Of course. Here is a new, highly detailed `implementation_todo.md` file designed to configure the project for local development with a proxy.

The plan is structured with extreme simplicity and clarity, making it ideal for an autonomous 4B LLM agent to execute flawlessly. Each step is an atomic, verifiable action.

Here is the content for the new file:

# `implementation_todo.md` - Local Proxy Configuration

**Project Goal:** To create the necessary configuration files and update existing ones to allow the entire application to be run locally via Docker Compose through an HTTP/HTTPS proxy.

**Guiding Principle:** Complete each task in the exact order it is presented. Verify each step before proceeding to the next.

---

## Feature 1: Create Proxy Environment Configuration

**Goal:** Establish a dedicated environment file for proxy settings.

*   `[x]` **F1.1: Create the proxy environment example file**
    *   **File:** `ai_dev_bot_platform/.env.example.proxy` (Create this new file)
    *   **Action:** Add the following content to the new file. This file will serve as a template for users who need a proxy.
        ```env
        # Proxy Settings
        # Fill these with your corporate or local proxy server details.
        # Example: http://proxy.example.com:8080
        HTTP_PROXY=http://your_proxy_ip:port
        HTTPS_PROXY=http://your_proxy_ip:port

        # Comma-separated list of hostnames that should NOT go through the proxy.
        # This is crucial for letting the 'app' container talk to 'postgres' and 'redis' directly.
        NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,postgres,redis
        ```
    *   **Verification:** The new file `.env.example.proxy` exists in the `ai_dev_bot_platform` directory and contains the specified content.

---

## Feature 2: Update Dockerfile to Use Proxy Settings

**Goal:** Modify the `Dockerfile` to accept and use the proxy environment variables during the image build process.

*   `[x]` **F2.1: Add ARG and ENV instructions to the Dockerfile**
    *   **File:** `ai_dev_bot_platform/Dockerfile`
    *   **Action:** Locate the `ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` line. Insert the following block of code directly after it. This tells Docker to expect proxy arguments during the build and to set them as environment variables inside the container.
        ```dockerfile
        # Set up proxy arguments
        ARG HTTP_PROXY
        ARG HTTPS_PROXY
        ARG NO_PROXY

        # Set proxy environment variables
        ENV HTTP_PROXY=$HTTP_PROXY
        ENV HTTPS_PROXY=$HTTPS_PROXY
        ENV NO_PROXY=$NO_PROXY
        ```
    *   **Verification:** The `Dockerfile` now contains the `ARG` and `ENV` instructions for `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY`.

---

## Feature 3: Create a Dedicated Docker Compose File for Proxy Setup

**Goal:** Create a new Docker Compose file that injects the proxy settings into the application container during build and at runtime.

*   `[x]` **F3.1: Create the `docker-compose.proxy.yml` file**
    *   **File:** `ai_dev_bot_platform/docker-compose.proxy.yml` (Create this new file)
    *   **Action:** Add the following content. This file will be used *in addition* to the main `docker-compose.yml` to add the proxy configuration.
        ```yaml
        version: '3.8'

        # This file is an overlay for the main docker-compose.yml.
        # It adds proxy configuration to the 'app' service.
        # To use it, run: docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.proxy.yml up

        services:
          app:
            # Pass proxy settings to the Docker build process for 'pip install'
            build:
              args:
                - HTTP_PROXY=${HTTP_PROXY}
                - HTTPS_PROXY=${HTTPS_PROXY}
                - NO_PROXY=${NO_PROXY}
            # Pass proxy settings to the running container for runtime requests (e.g., to LLM APIs)
            environment:
              - HTTP_PROXY=${HTTP_PROXY}
              - HTTPS_PROXY=${HTTPS_PROXY}
              - NO_PROXY=${NO_PROXY}
            # Load the proxy settings from a dedicated .env.proxy file
            env_file:
              - .env.proxy
        ```
    *   **Verification:** The new file `docker-compose.proxy.yml` exists in the `ai_dev_bot_platform` directory and contains the specified YAML content.

---

## Feature 4: Document the New Proxy Setup

**Goal:** Update the main `README.md` file with clear instructions on how to use the new proxy development flow.

*   `[x]` **F4.1: Add "Running with a Proxy" section to README.md**
    *   **File:** `README.md`
    *   **Action:** Find the "ðŸš€ Running Locally" section. At the very end of this section, add a new subsection with the following content:
        ```markdown
        ### Running with a Proxy

        If you are behind a corporate or local proxy, follow these steps instead of the standard `docker-compose up`.

        1.  **Create a Proxy Environment File:** Copy the proxy environment template.
            ```bash
            cp ai_dev_bot_platform/.env.example.proxy ai_dev_bot_platform/.env.proxy
            ```

        2.  **Edit `.env.proxy`:** Open the new `ai_dev_bot_platform/.env.proxy` file and fill in your `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` details.

        3.  **Build and Run with Proxy Config:** Use both `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.proxy.yml` files. The `-f` flag allows you to specify multiple files, which are merged together.
            ```bash
            docker-compose -f ai_dev_bot_platform/docker-compose.yml -f ai_dev_bot_platform/docker-compose.proxy.yml up -d --build
            ```
            This will start all services (app, postgres, redis) and correctly inject your proxy settings into the `app` container for both the build process and runtime.

        4.  **Apply Migrations:** This step is the same. Run migrations inside the running `app` container:
            ```bash
            docker-compose -f ai_dev_bot_platform/docker-compose.yml -f ai_dev_bot_platform/docker-compose.proxy.yml exec app alembic upgrade head
            ```
        ```
    *   **Verification:** The `README.md` file now contains the new "Running with a Proxy" section with the correct instructions and commands.

Okay, let's create a very detailed TODO list specifically for addressing the critical issues and next steps identified in your summary. This list is designed to be followed sequentially by "Roo" (the 4B LLM), with clear actions and verifications.

This will become a new TODO file, perhaps named `refactor_and_fix_todo.md`.

**Project Goal:** Resolve structural issues, implement missing critical components, and address inconsistencies identified in the previous implementation review.
**Primary Focus:** Project structure, database session management, service consistency.
**Source of Truth for Original Intent:** `todos/implementation_todo.md` (for P0.8 specifically) and the previous verification report.
